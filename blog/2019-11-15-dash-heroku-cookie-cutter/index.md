title: How to Deploy a Containerized Python Dash App to Heroku

I love using Plotly to build interactive visualizations. The syntax is very similar across R and Python, and plots looks great.

One challenge I have found is sharing these dashboards in the wild. This blog posts walks you through how to build a Plotly Dash App in a docker container that you can deploy to Heroku.

You can see the app live here:

**Why did I create this project?**

- There are many tutorials on how to use Dash, Flask, Heroku, and Containers. But, I could not find any that included all of these elements.
- I have found it tricky to get Pandas working on some virtual environments and/or containers
- I will use this as a basic starting point for future dash/heroku projects

## Getting Started

*Note: many ideas were taken from [https://medium.com/@ksashok/](https://medium.com/@ksashok/containerise-your-python-flask-using-docker-and-deploy-it-onto-heroku-a0b48d025e43) for this README.*

### Step 1: setting up files locally

Create a new directory in your computer and create the following file structure:

```
.
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── data
│   └── gapminder.csv
└── requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: `app.py`

Create your dash app. See **app.py** for complete details. A few important things to note:

```python
port: int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5000))
```

You must use the above code for Heroku to find the correct port. If not, you may get:

```
Web process failed to bind $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
```

Thanks to [Ashok's blog post](https://medium.com/@ksashok/containerise-your-python-flask-using-docker-and-deploy-it-onto-heroku-a0b48d025e43) for this tip.

At the end of your `app.py` file you should have the following code:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=False,
                   host="0.0.0.0",
                   port=port)
```

The key part of the above code is to have `port=port`. 

### Step 3: `Dockerfile` and `Requirements.txt`

I chose to use a docker image ([amancevice/pandas](https://hub.docker.com/r/amancevice/pandas)) that started with Pandas, and then add in the dash requirements though the `Dockerfile`. 

`Dockerfile`

- Calling `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` at the end of the file runs the app.

`Requirements.txt`

-  At this stage I have not yet tagged the libraries with specific versions. It seems to be working without the tags fow now.

### Step 4: Building the docker image

In the terminal entering the following command:

```bash
docker image build -t dash-heroku:latest .
```

Next you can validate if the image is working by running the image:

```
docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 dash-heroku
```

To see if your app is running open [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) (you can click on this link and it should take you to your app).

While developing my app I found it helpful to use VS code with the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker). It lets you develop from within the container so you can update your code and test in the container with less fussing around on the command line.

### Step 5: Deploying to Heroku

To deploy to Heroku you must have the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed. Once it is installed you can do the following in the command line.

Log into Heroku:

```
heroku container:login
```

Create a new app on Heroku, where it says `dash-heroku-cookie-cutter` choose any name you like:

```
heroku create dash-heroku-cookie-cutter
```

Create the container in Heroku:

```
heroku container:push web --app dash-heroku-cookie-cutter
```

Then release the app:

```
heroku container:release web --app dash-heroku-cookie-cutter
```

You should now be able to visit your app and see it in action. You can visit mine here:

## Using Containers vs. Virtual Environments

There are two ways I have deployed apps to Heroku:
- Using conda virtual environments (e.g. [Canadian election sentiment analysis](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/sentiment-cdn-election))
- Using containers (e.g. this project)

Overall I would recommend using the container process. I found even with using virtual environments there were many times were the app would run locally, but then would not run when I push to Heroku. Additionally, as my virtual environment grew in size Heroku began rejecting it because it was over 500 MB. With containers I don't believe this limit exists.
