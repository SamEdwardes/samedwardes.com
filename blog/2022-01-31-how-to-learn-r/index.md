As a data scientist one of the most common questions I get from colleagues and clients is how to get started on learning R. There is a plethora of great options out there today. Some of which are paid, and some of which are free.

<!--truncate-->

## TL/DR

The best ways to learn R are:

- [Coursera Data Science Specialization (John Hopkins University)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by *Hadley Wickham* and *Garret Grolemund*
- [Advanced R ](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html) by *Hadley Wickham* and *Garret Grolemund*
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by *Hadley Wickham*
- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) by *Hadley Wickham*

## My top recommendation - Coursera Data Science Specialization

My number one recommendation is the **[Coursera Data Science Specialization (John Hopkins University)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)** course. This course will leave you with a solid foundation in base R, the Tidyverse, the concept of tidy data, and concept of reproducibility, and many common data science algorithms.

**Pros:**

- Suitable for everyone. There is very little prerequisite knowledge required.
- Free and paid options (paid options provides a certificate upon completion). If you are able to afford the cost I would recommend opting for the paid version of the course. It is a good way to support the content creators, and personally I find it more motivating to completes the course when I have some "skin in the game".
- Engaging and interesting instructors.

**Cons:**

- The course was created several years ago. I cannot find the exact date, but the R eco system is growing rapidly and constantly changing. Some topics may be slightly out of date.
- Big time commitment (estimated time is 11 months, for me it took about 10 months).

If you want to develop an R package this book is an invaluable resource that I have referenced many times.
