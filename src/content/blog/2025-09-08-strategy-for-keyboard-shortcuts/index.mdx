I use a lot of keyboard shortcuts on my computer. I try to use the mouse as little as possible. Remembering all the shortcuts I use daily would be really challenging. Instead of relying on raw memorization, I use a set of consistent patterns and strategies to make it easier. There’s still a lot of memorization involved, but these patterns simplify things.

## Top-level categories

- Navigation: <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd>
- Launching applications: <kbd>Meh</kbd>
- Raycast commands: <kbd>Hyper</kbd>
- Managing windows with Aerospace: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>
- Managing panes (e.g., Neovim windows): <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd>

In my experience, using <kbd>Meh</kbd>, <kbd>Hyper</kbd>, <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>, and <kbd>^ Control</kbd> typically avoids conflicts with application-specific shortcuts, which usually involve <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> and/or <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>.

## Navigation (left, right, up, down)

At the core of my workflow are the Vim navigation keys. Whenever an action involves a specific direction, I always use the Vim navigation keys with a modifier.

- Left: <kbd>h</kbd>
- Down: <kbd>j</kbd>
- Up: <kbd>k</kbd>
- Right: <kbd>l</kbd>

## Launching applications

The apps I use most often can be launched with the <kbd>Meh</kbd> key. "Meh" is shorthand for <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>. Wherever possible, I use mnemonics so shortcuts are easy to remember. I configure them in Raycast.

Here are a few examples:

- Vivaldi (web **b**rowser): <kbd>Meh</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>
- **O**bsidian: <kbd>Meh</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd>
- **W**ezTerm: <kbd>Meh</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd>

## Raycast commands

In addition to launching applications, I also use Raycast to invoke shortcuts. These are always triggered with <kbd>Hyper</kbd>. "Hyper" is shorthand for <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd>.

I try to choose mnemonics to make them memorable. A few examples:

- Fix spelling and **g**rammar: <kbd>Hyper</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd>
- Open Raycast **c**alendar: <kbd>Hyper</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
- Search **m**enu items: <kbd>Hyper</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>

## Managing windows with Aerospace

I use Aerospace to move between and organize windows. Most of my Aerospace shortcuts are mapped to <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>:

- Focus on window to the left: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>
- Focus on window to the right: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd>
- Focus on window above: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>
- Focus on window below: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd>

Whenever moving left, right, up, or down is involved, I try to incorporate the Vim navigation keys. This sometimes complicates things because I also want to use them for swapping panes. To handle this, I use <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> along with <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> when swapping windows in Aerospace:

- Swap with window to the left: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>
- Swap with window to the right: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd>
- Swap with window above: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>
- Swap with window below: <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd>

## Managing panes

Some of the applications I use support multiple panes—for example, in Neovim you can have several panes open.

To move between panes, I use <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> as my prefix with the Vim navigation keys:

- Focus on pane to the left: <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>
- Focus on pane to the right: <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd>
- Focus on pane above: <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>
- Focus on pane below: <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd>

In my web browser, I’ve also mapped:

- <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> to
  move between tabs
- <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> and <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> to
  navigate between [workspaces](https://vivaldi.com/features/workspaces/)
