import Callout from '../../../components/Callout.astro'

I usually create a `requirements.txt` when I start a new Python project. I will do something like this:

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir new-project
cd new-project

# Create requirements.txt
tee -a requirements.txt <<EOF
pandas
pyarrow
EOF

# Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This lets me get a new project up and running quickly. I have documented which packages I am using, which is good, but I have not documented which version of the package I am using. Since it is a new project, I want to use the latest version of every package. I could search PyPI for each package and find the latest version, but that takes a lot of time. Instead, I only document the package name in my initial `requirements.txt`. When I am ready to pin the versions, I use this bash script to check the version I have installed for each dependency listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python -m pip freeze | grep -E $(cat requirements.txt | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/==|/g')
```

The result will be something like this:

```bash
pandas==2.1.4
pyarrow==14.0.2
```

I can then paste this output into my `requirements.txt` file.

<Callout title="Why not use `pip freeze`?">
I could have also used `pip freeze` to get the version of the packages I have installed. The downside is that it will get the installed version of every package. Usually, I only want to pin the "top-level" dependency and not the sub-dependencies. For example, if I have `pandas` installed, I do not want to pin the version of `numpy` that `pandas` depends on. I only want to pin the version of `pandas` itself. I find that this makes it easier to update packages for my project in the future.
