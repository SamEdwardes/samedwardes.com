I have known about [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for some time, but until recently, I never tried it. This week, I started to try out pre-commit, and I am finding it very useful. Here are a few pre-commits I have found useful for data science workflows.

## Installation

```bash
# Install pre-commit with `uv`
uv tool install pre-commit

# Set up pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Helpful pre-commit hooks

Copy the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your project. To run everything, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
