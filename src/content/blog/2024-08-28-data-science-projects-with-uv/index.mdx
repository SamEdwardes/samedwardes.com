<Callout title="Update: 2024-09-04">

After writing this blog post I posted a few issues on the uv GitHub repo:

- [#6780: Use uv init to lock to a particular Python version](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6780)
- [#6781: Add the option to uv add to pin to latest version of package](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/6781)

Based on what I learned in these issues I have made a few updates to this blog post:

- Use `.python-version` to specify desired Python version for the project.
- Don't pin package version in `pyproject.toml`, let `uv.lock` handle the pinning.
- Use `uv export` to generate a `requirements.txt` file.

</Callout>

[Astral](https://astral.sh/) recently announced a slew of new features for uv [https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging](https://astral.sh/blog/uv-unified-python-packaging). uv is now a complete tool for all of your python needs:

- Managing your Python installation (I used to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv))
- Managing Python projects (I used to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
- Building Python packages (I used to use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/))
- Managing Python tooling (I used to use [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx))
- Running Python scripts (I would run scripts using my global Python interpreter or custom virtual environments)

As someone who works in data science, here is how I plan to integrate uv into my regular workflows.

## TL/DR

<Callout title="uv version">
uv is rapidly changing! This blog post was written using version `0.4.9`.
</Callout>

```bash
# Create a new project
mkdir example-project
cd example-project
uv init --app --python 3.12.5

# Add a package
uv add requests
uv add httpx

# Remove a package
uv remove httpx

# Run code
uv run hello.py

# Run other tools
uvx ruff format .

# Generate a requirements.txt
uv exoprt > requirements.txt
```

## Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

## Create a new project

My first decision is what version of Python I want to use. Typically, I want to use the most recent version, which is 3.12.5 ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)). You can check which versions of Python are available to uv by running:

```bash
uv python list --all-versions
```

To only see the most recent versions you can pipe the output to `head` and `grep`:

```bash
uv python list --all-versions | head | grep 'download available'
# cpython-3.12.5-macos-aarch64-none     <download available>
# cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none     <download available>
# cpython-3.12.2-macos-aarch64-none     <download available>
# cpython-3.12.1-macos-aarch64-none     <download available>
# cpython-3.12.0-macos-aarch64-none     <download available>
```

With my Python version selected, I am ready to bootstrap my project. Note that we pass the `--app` flag because this is a project, not a Python library.

```bash
mkdir example-project
cd example-project
uv init --app --python 3.12.5
```

My project has now been bootstrapped with the following files:

```bash
.
├── .python-version
├── hello.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

**.python-version**

```bash
3.12.5
```

**hello.py**

```python
def main():
    print("Hello from example-project!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**pyproject.toml**

```toml
[project]
name = "example-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12.5"
dependencies = []
```

**README.md**

*Note: the README is empty.*

```markdown
```

Before proceeding, add a short project description to the README.md and the pyproject.toml description section.

## Run your code

When using uv to manage your project, the preferred way to run your code is by using `uv run <name-of-script>` (as opposed to `python <name-of-script>`):

```bash
uv run hello.py
# Using Python 3.12.5 interpreter at: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12
# Creating virtualenv at: .venv
# Hello from example-project!
```

The first time that you invoke `uv run`, a few things happen:

- uv will try to find the version of Python you want on your computer. If it is not available, uv will automatically install it for you.
- uv will create a virtual environment at `./.venv`, using your desired version of Python.
- Lastly, uv will execute your script using the virtual environment.

<Callout title="Why not use `python hello.py`?">

It would also be valid to do the following:

```bash
# create the virtual environment and install packages
uv sync

# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# run the code
python hello.py
```

However, I prefer to go all in with `uv`. The main advantage is that `uv run` always uses a virtual environment. You do not need to remember to create and activate one.

</Callout>

## Add a package

To add packages with uv you use `uv add <package>` (as opposed to `pip install <package>`):

```bash
uv add requests
# Resolved 6 packages in 130ms
# Prepared 5 packages in 0.81ms
# Installed 5 packages in 5ms
#  + certifi==2024.8.30
#  + charset-normalizer==3.3.2
#  + idna==3.8
#  + requests==2.32.3
#  + urllib3==2.2.2
```

After running `uv add`, the pyproject.toml has been updated to include requests:

```toml
[project]
name = "example-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add your description here"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12.5"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.32.3",
]
```

One thing to note is how the requests package has been pinned:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.32.3",
]
```

Since this is a Data Science project, as opposed to a Python library that we would publish to PyPI, I want to be confident that I can re-run this code using all of the exact same dependencies on another machine. This is where the `uv.lock` files comes in. Our project now has this structure:

```bash
.
├── .python-version
├── .venv
├── hello.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── uv.lock
```

The `uv.lock` file describes the exact resolved versions of every package this is installed in my environment. Here is a snippet from the `uv.lock` file that shows how requests is pinned to version `2.32.3`:

```toml
version = 1
requires-python = ">=3.12.5"

...

[[package]]
name = "requests"
version = "2.32.3"
source = { registry = "https://pypi.org/simple" }
dependencies = [
    { name = "certifi" },
    { name = "charset-normalizer" },
    { name = "idna" },
    { name = "urllib3" },
]
sdist = { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/63/70/2bf7780ad2d390a8d301ad0b550f1581eadbd9a20f896afe06353c2a2913/requests-2.32.3.tar.gz", hash = "sha256:55365417734eb18255590a9ff9eb97e9e1da868d4ccd6402399eaf68af20a760", size = 131218 }
wheels = [
    { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/9b/335f9764261e915ed497fcdeb11df5dfd6f7bf257d4a6a2a686d80da4d54/requests-2.32.3-py3-none-any.whl", hash = "sha256:70761cfe03c773ceb22aa2f671b4757976145175cdfca038c02654d061d6dcc6", size = 64928 },
]
```

## Adding and removing packages

Additional packages can be added with the `uv add <package-name>` command. To remove packages, use `uv remove <package-name>`. The `uv remove` command is similar to the `pip uninstall` command. The most important difference is that `uv remove` not only removes the package you specify but also all of the transitive dependencies. For example, let's make the following changes:

- Add [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/)
- Remove [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html)

First, let us check all of the packages in our environment:

```bash
uv pip freeze
# certifi==2024.8.30
# charset-normalizer==3.3.2
# idna==3.8
# requests==2.32.3
# urllib3==2.2.2
```

Then, use `uv add` and `uv remove` to update the environment:

```bash
uv add httpx
uv remove requests

uv pip freeze
# anyio==4.4.0
# certifi==2024.8.30
# h11==0.14.0
# httpcore==1.0.5
# httpx==0.27.2
# idna==3.8
# sniffio==1.3.1
```

There are a few important things to note:

- httpx is now installed.
- certifi is still installed, even though we uninstalled requests. It is still in the environment because both httpx and requests depend on this library.
- Both pyproject.toml and uv.lock has been updated to reflect all of the changes.

## Generating a requirements.txt

uv creates a pyproject.toml and a uv.lock file. These two files are all you need to recreate your Python environment anywhere. However, some tools won't know what to do with these files and instead require a good old fashion requirements.txt. Use the following command to generate a requirements.txt:

```bash
uv export --output-file requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**

```bash
# This file was autogenerated via `uv export`.

```

## Running other tools (e.g. linters and formatters)

I often want to run additional tooling on my code base that is not a requirement for my project. For example, I like using the ruff formatter to format my code. I could include these tools as dependencies in my project, but I prefer to keep my project dependencies separate from my tooling dependencies. I used pipx for this in the past, but now I use the `uvx` command. For example, here is how I would format my code using ruff:

```bash
uvx ruff check --select I --fix .
uvx ruff format .
```
