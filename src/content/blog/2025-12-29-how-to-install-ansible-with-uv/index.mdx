The official Ansible [docs](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) show how to install Ansible with pipx.

```bash
pipx install --include-deps ansible
```

uv has no equivalent to --include-deps. To ensure that all the required packages are installed, use the following command:


```bash
uv tool install ansible-core --with ansible
```

```bash
uv tool list
# ansible-core v2.15.13
# - ansible
# - ansible-config
# - ansible-connection
# - ansible-console
# - ansible-doc
# - ansible-galaxy
# - ansible-inventory
# - ansible-playbook
# - ansible-pull
# - ansible-test
# - ansible-vault
```
