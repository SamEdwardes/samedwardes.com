description: uv is "an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust" from https://astral.sh. Recently, I have started using uv in my day-to-day Python workflows. After a few weeks of usage I am sold! uv will be my go-to package manager for Python projects moving forward. It is MUCH faster than pip and I really like the new workflow it provides me with `uv pip compile` and `uv pip sync`.

Test

import Test from '../../../components/Test.astro'
import TabGroup from '../../../components/TabGroup.vue'
import TabList from '../../../components/TabList.vue'
import Tab from '../../../components/Tab.vue'
import TabPanels from '../../../components/TabPanels.vue'
import TabPanel from '../../../components/TabPanel.vue'

import Tabs2 from '../../../components/Tabs2.astro'
import TabHeader2 from '../../../components/TabHeader2.astro'
import TabContent2 from '../../../components/TabContent2.astro'


## First tabs

<Test/>

## Second tabs

<Tabs2>
    <Fragment slot="tab-headers">
        <TabHeader2>Tab 1 (one)</TabHeader2>
        <TabHeader2>Tab 2</TabHeader2>
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab-content">
        <TabContent2>

This is content in tab 1:

```bash
echo 'hello world'
```

        </TabContent2>
        <TabContent2>Content 2</TabContent2>
    </Fragment>
</Tabs2>
