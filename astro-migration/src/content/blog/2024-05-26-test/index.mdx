description: uv is "an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust" from https://astral.sh. Recently, I have started using uv in my day-to-day Python workflows. After a few weeks of usage I am sold! uv will be my go-to package manager for Python projects moving forward. It is MUCH faster than pip and I really like the new workflow it provides me with `uv pip compile` and `uv pip sync`.

import Tabs from '../../../components/Tabs.astro'
import TabHeader from '../../../components/TabHeader.astro'
import TabContent from '../../../components/TabContent.astro'


## Second tabs

<Tabs>
    <Fragment slot="tab-headers">
        <TabHeader>Tab 1 (one)</TabHeader>
        <TabHeader>Tab 2</TabHeader>
    </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab-content">
        <TabContent>

This is content in tab 1:

```bash
echo 'hello world'
```

        </TabContent>
        <TabContent>Content 2</TabContent>
    </Fragment>
</Tabs>
