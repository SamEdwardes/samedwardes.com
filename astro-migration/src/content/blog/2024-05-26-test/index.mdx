description: uv is "an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust" from https://astral.sh. Recently, I have started using uv in my day-to-day Python workflows. After a few weeks of usage I am sold! uv will be my go-to package manager for Python projects moving forward. It is MUCH faster than pip and I really like the new workflow it provides me with `uv pip compile` and `uv pip sync`.
