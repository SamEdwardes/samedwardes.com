Over the past year I have dedicated a lot of time to learning Kubernetes. Here are the resources I have found most helpful!

- [Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners (FULL COURSE in 4 Hours)](https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do)
- [Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/)
- [Kubernetes: Up and Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781492046523/) by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Lachlan Evenson

**[Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners (FULL COURSE in 4 Hours)](https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do)**

I would recommend starting with this video. After taking this four hour crash course you will have a basic understanding of how Kubernetes works, and you will have a Kubernetes cluster running on your computer you can use for further learning.

**[Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/)**

This course is very comprehensive and will prepare you for the [CKA Exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/). I found this course to be my favourite resource. There are only two downsides:

- It is expensive. The course alone costs $299 USD. The course and the CKA Exam cost $595 USD. (As of 2023-04-15). However, if you can afford it, I think putting a little bit of skin in the game is a good motivator to learn and take the course seriously.
- The course also takes some time to complete. The course took me about 3 months to complete spending a few hours each weekend.

This book is a good reference and will be nice resource to have in the future. However, it is also a bit pricey.
